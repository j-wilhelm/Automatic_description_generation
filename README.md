Code for Thesis titled FashionDesc -  Automatic Description Generation for Fashion Articles Based on Images.

This is the code for my Master's thesis. Unfortunately, the code cannot be structured very well and changes would need to be made if you want to run it yourself. The code is written to be ran on a cluster. Therefore, all scripts import directly from each other. Some scripts are run locally, such as the neatly structuring of results and adding diversity metrics. Specifically, the script expects the following structure locally.

```
.
|-- Results <br>
    |-- w1_results <br>
        |-- all_results <br>
    |-- w2_results <br> 
        |-- all_results <br>
```
